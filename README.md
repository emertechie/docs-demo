# Demonstration Site

This is a WIP documentation demo site. It uses:

- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)
- [Vale](https://vale.sh/)
- GitHub actions to lint and build site on PRs and pushes to main branch

### Local Development

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```bash
npm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
