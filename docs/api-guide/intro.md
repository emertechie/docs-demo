# Introduction

The Open Food Facts API enables access to the [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) database.

The Open Food Facts database is a collaborative project to create a global database of food products with nutrition information.

You can use the Open Food Facts API to:

- Get information about products such as ingredients and nutritional values
- Build applications that allow users to contribute to the database
- Empower users to make healthier food choices

:::note

Community members maintain the Open Food Facts database. As a result, there are no assurances that the data is accurate, complete, or reliable.
