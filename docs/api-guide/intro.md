# Introduction

The Open Food Facts API enables access to the [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) database.

The Open Food Facts database is a food products database made by everyone, for everyone, that can help you make better choices about what you eat. Being open data, anyone can reuse it for any purpose.

You can use the Open Food Facts API to:

- Get information like ingredients and nutritional values of products
- Build applications that allow users to contribute to the database
- Empower users to make healthier food choices

:::note

Users who want to support the program voluntarily provide the data in the Open Food Facts database. As a result, there are no assurances that the data is accurate, complete, or reliable. The user assumes the entire risk of using the data.
