This API allows to create or update a product (if the product already exists, its data is updated, otherwise it is created), or to analyze a test product (in which case no product is created or updated). To analyze a product, the "barcode" path component needs to contain the value "test" instead of a barcode.

New API to send structured product data in a JSON format instead of in a flattened list of key / value pairs field as-in the current product add / edit API that relies on a multipart/form-data format.

Important: this new Product WRITE API is under development. The initial deployment will support only packaging fields.

This new API will be used in particular to send structured packaging data: https://openfoodfacts.github.io/openfoodfacts-server/dev/explain-packaging-data/

The new API can then be gradually extended to support other product fields.
