:::info About this site

<!-- vale off -->

This is a documentation demo site. The source is available [here](https://github.com/emertechie/docs-demo/). I based the content on the [Open Food Facts website](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) and [documentation](https://openfoodfacts.github.io/openfoodfacts-server/), but restructured or rewrote most of it. I did use the original OpenAPI files, however, to generate the [API Reference](/docs/category/api-v2) area.

**Noteable content:**

- [Reading and writing product data](/docs/api-guide/tutorials/reading-writing-product-data) - versus the [original content](https://openfoodfacts.github.io/openfoodfacts-server/api/tutorial-off-api/)
- [Authentication guide](/docs/api-guide/authentication) - versus the [original content](https://openfoodfacts.github.io/openfoodfacts-server/api/#authentication)
- Unrelated to this site: a [How To Guide takehome exercise](/docs/create-remark-plugin), max 2 pages
