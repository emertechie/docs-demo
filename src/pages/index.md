This is a WIP demonstration site. The source is available [here](https://github.com/emertechie/docs-demo/).

I based the content on the [Open Food Facts documentation](https://openfoodfacts.github.io/openfoodfacts-server/), but restructured or rewrote most of it. However, I used the original OpenAPI files to generate the [API Reference](/docs/category/api-v2) area. I will be helping complete the OpenAPI spec for the v3 API, which is currently unfinished.
